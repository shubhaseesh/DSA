## DSA solutions in Python.

## About

I created this repository to keep track of my progress, showcase my problem-solving skills, and share my solutions with others who might find them helpful.

## Why DSA Practice?

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a crucial role in becoming a skilled programmer. Regular DSA practice helps improve problem-solving skills, optimize code, and build a strong foundation for technical interviews.

## How to Use This Repository?

This repository is organized into folders, where each folder corresponds to a specific topic. Inside each folder, you will find the solution(s) to the DSA problem(s) I solved on that day.

Feel free to explore the solutions, provide feedback, or suggest better approaches. I'm open to learning from others and appreciate any constructive input.

## Folder Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ project-euler
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem_1_solution.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem_2_solution.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Getting Started

To run the Python solutions, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can run any Python script using the command:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of the Python file you want to execute.
